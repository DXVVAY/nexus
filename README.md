# Welcome to Nexus shitshow

Nexus was fully coded and maintained by me (dexv). the other "developer" (cyprian(retard)) had like 7 useless commits

I decided to release it since It got leaked by cyprian cuz he has trust issues, but somehow trusts everything he hears.

```
print("diggers rhymes with what?")
fmt.Println("diggers rhymes with what?")
console.log("diggers rhymes with what?");
printf("diggers rhymes with what?\n");
```
# Cyprian (xavier/ksawier) is a skid

He claims he can code in js and other shit but just like always he is another skid that i thought had skill and attempted to work with, and he turned out to be a manipulative asshole. he would always get mad if something doesnt go his way.

> his exitscams: He already has a bad reputation in maintaining projects, and has like 7 projects that he exitscammed, or atleast thats what ive heard, he fucked my reputation too

and thats why i would say that its **NOT** worth it to start a project with him.

## his fire project

Nitro sniper service which probs steals your token, might not be true.

but I wouldnt trust him with anything like that, but ofc its your choice

he claims that he coded it, but who knows, its a simple thing to make and knowing him he doesnt have the skill for that

# Nexus Breakdown
Nexus raider consists of four components:

Core 1: plugins - proprietary components : primary utilities, Config, Logging, Headers, Session, Scraper and Websocket.

Core 2: Functions - Discord API edpoints + User Input + Threading.

Core 3: Bypasses - Various bypasses for example Wick verify bypass, Restorecord, Sledge Hammer and Server Rules.

Core 4: Solvers - Solver apis like Hcoptcha, Capsolver.

The main.py imports should be compiled in the order described.

# Nexus Session Breakdown
Nexus session system consists of three components:

1. Headers Number 1 - iOS Mobile: [
   * gets the app version through [Discord App (App Store)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/discord-chat-talk-hangout/id985746746)
   * uses the app version to get the build number from the latest manifest [discord.com/ios/(app_version)/manifest.json](https://discord.com/ios/206.0/manifest.json)
   * utilizes **uuid** package to randomize the vendor id and the iphone module
   * builds the x_super_properties using the previous gathered information
   * and then fnally returns the freshly built headers
   
   ]

   Headers Number 2 - Windows Client: [
   * gets the native build version through [updtes.discord.com](https://updates.discord.com/distributions/app/manifests/latest)
   * gets the main build version from [discord.com/api/downloads/distributions/app/installers/latest](https://discord.com/api/downloads/distributions/app/installers/latest)
   * gets the page [discord.com/app](https://discord.com/app) and uses the **re** package to find the client build number in the page
   * builds the x_super_properties using the previous gathered information
   * and then fnally returns the freshly built headers
     
   ]
    

1. Tls_session: utilizes **tls_client** to make a secure connection.

2. Cookies: uses the current session to get the cookies from [discord.com](https://discord.com) and them uses them as the session cookies

Finally it uses one of the headers to send requests to the discord API very securely
